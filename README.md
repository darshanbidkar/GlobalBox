# GlobalBox
GlobalBox is a prototype for an idea to provide a single point access to data distributed over various cloud storages.
This idea was part of a 3-day hackathon sponsored by Tech-Mahindra (Event: Tech-M i5 hackathon).

Are you a fan of cloud storages? Do you like to keep your device simple and unclogged? GlobalBox is an idea to help you deal with it. The team who developed this is an avid and enthusiastic user of cloud storages and sharing files to and fro to various cloud storages was always a problem we faced. 
This app helps you view contents of your cloud storages in a single view. You can download/open the file and work on it. 


Future scope:
<br>
-Integrate other cloud storages such as: Box, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.<br>
-Enable sharing permissions (This is relatively an easy feature to integrate but due to the time constraints, we decided to work on it later)<br>
-Cross cloud file moving operations (copy/move files seamlessly over clouds)<br>
-Imparting useful information (Provide the user with a pie chart or better about the total space available including all clouds)<br>
